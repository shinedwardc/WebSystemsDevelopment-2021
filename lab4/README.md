# Reflection
In this lab, I was in charge of the tutoring.html page, including css styling. I also contributed to organizing json data, specifically in information with the members of GNH.
Some css elements I used included the use of float, box hover, shadow, and figure/figcaption tags.
In this lab specifically, I was stuck in understanding how to use ajax with jquery to call json data into the html file, as I had few experience with ajax.

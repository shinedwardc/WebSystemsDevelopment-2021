            <h1>Article 6</h1>
            <h2>Original Wording:</h2>
            <p>All Debts contracted and Engagements entered into, before the Adoption of this Constitution, shall be as valid against the United States under this Constitution, as under the Confederation.</p>
            <p>This Constitution, and the Laws of the United States which shall be made in Pursuance thereof; and all Treaties made, or which shall be made, under the Authority of the United States, shall be the supreme Law of the Land; and the Judges in every State shall be bound thereby, any Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding.</p>
            <p>The Senators and Representatives before mentioned, and the Members of the several State Legislatures, and all executive and judicial Officers, both of the United States and of the several States, shall be bound by Oath or Affirmation, to support this Constitution; but no religious Test shall ever be required as a Qualification to any Office or public Trust under the United States.</p>
            <h2>Summary:</h2>
            <p>The first claues of Article VI promises that all of the debts and agreements made before the Constitution was written will still be honored once the Constitution had been made law. The next clause states that the Constitution, and any other national laws made, are the "Supreme Law of the Land", meaning that the laws set out in the constitution can override any state or local laws that disagree with the Constitution. Finally, this article says that all elected officials will be sworn into their office, meaning they promise to do their duty and protect the country. </p>

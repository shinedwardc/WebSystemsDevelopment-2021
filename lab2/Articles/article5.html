            <h2>Summary:</h2>
            <p>Article V outlines the process of adding to the Constitution. When writing the Constitution, the framers knew that they could not possibly write down everything needed for a long lasting goverment, so they made sure to give instructions to ensure that the Constitution could be expanded. New Amendments cna be proposed by either 2/3 agreement in the House and Senate, or by 3/4 of the state legislatures. </p>

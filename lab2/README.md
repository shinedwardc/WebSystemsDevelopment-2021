# Reflection
This time I focused on the semantic correctness and markup style. I wrote detailed analyses for Articles 1-4, using the article tag for each section, and made sure I used
proper header (h1, h2, h3), p tags, and div for utilizing css elements. I also made some css elements, including highligting bullet points (.bullet-point-notes), and putting interesting or fun facts as a side note
in (.info-note).

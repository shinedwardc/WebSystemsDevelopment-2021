The Arch is a requirement of the Rensselaer curriculum.</p>
                <p>Summer Here</p>
                <p>During The Arch, students remain on campus for the summer after their sophomore year, taking junior-level classes, and receive focused attention from professors at this pivotal point in their academic progression. </p>
                <p>The World Away</p>
                <p>Then, students leave the Troy campus for a semester during the traditional junior year either fall or spring to pursue their passions in the form of co-ops, internships, civic engagement, research, or international experiences. Students who pursue these opportunities during their academic career are better prepared for future professional careers and graduate school.</p>

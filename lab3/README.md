# Reflection
In this lab I focused on the semantic markup of HTML and CSS, and utilized a bit of Javascript so that I could finish the details of the site. I added a lot of css elements so that each text section or boxes had proper lineup and great visibility.
I utilized the concept of flexbox so that the websites looked more organized.
I really struggled with the Javascript animation part, because there were some flaws to the function, and it did not turn out the way I wanted it to be.
One thing that I could have done better in this lab was to  make the social media site better with more functionallity and design, and to finish the contact form as well. I didn't have enough time to finish the contact form.
